# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview
This is a report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Resources:
- Data Source: city_data.csv
- Data Source: ride_data.csv
- Software: Jupyter Notebook 6.4.5
- Library: Pandas
- Library: Matplotlib
- Language: Python 3.9.7

## Results: 


### Deliverable 1:

- Urban cities have the **highest number of rides and drivers**. 
- Rural cities have the **highest average fair per ride and per driver**.

### Deliverable 2:

Describes fare rates among different city types between 01/01/2019 & 04/28/2019.

## Summary:
My advice for CEOs would be:
- To increase the number of drivers in Rural cities to better meet the demand. 
- To increase the number of drivers in Suburbar citties to better meet the demand. 
- To decrease the number of drivers in Urban cities which would help increase the average driver's rate and promote a more sustanable balance.
